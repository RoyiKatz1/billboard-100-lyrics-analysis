        "plain": "Okay, so, \u201cWild Ones.\u201d Let\u2019s dive into that, because it\u2019s way more than just a catchy track. First time I heard it? Late night drive, that\u2019s a given. But here\u2019s the thing: I was actually on my way back from a terrible date. Like, the kind where you spend the whole time wondering if you accidentally wandered into a parallel universe where everyone is aggressively boring. And then \u201cWild Ones\u201d hits, and it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, this is the energy I needed.\u201d\nJessie and Jelly Roll, right? Collab of the year, hands down. But what people don\u2019t really know is that the initial demo Jessie sent Jelly Roll? It was way more stripped down. Think just her vocals and that jangly guitar loop. That verse that Jelly Roll added to the song, he actually wrote it in like, 20 minutes, sitting on his tour bus. He told a small group of peers at a meet and greet that it just poured out of him. Like, he lived that story.\nAnd about Jessie\u2019s whole \u201cdrawn to chaos\u201d thing? It\u2019s not just a persona. I\u2019ve heard from a few different sources that she keeps a journal filled with these almost poetic descriptions of the people she encounters \u2013 the ones with that spark of unpredictability. She\u2019s genuinely fascinated by the human experience when it\u2019s pushed to the edge.\nThe blend of country and hip-hop? That wasn\u2019t just a random choice. Jessie was apparently listening to a lot of old Outlaw country and early 2000s Memphis rap around the time she wrote it. She wanted to capture that feeling of rebellion, that sense of being outside the lines. And it worked.\nThe video? It\u2019s pure unedited chaos, but what most don\u2019t know is they had a very specific concept for the video. The original treatment was a much more staged, cinematic thing. But on the day of the shoot, they just threw it all out and decided to just be themselves. They wanted it to feel raw, real, and in the moment, which is why it has that authentic vibe.\nBut what really gets me about \u201cWild Ones\u201d is that it\u2019s not just about the thrill of the chase, the dangerous allure. It\u2019s about finding that kindred spirit, someone who sees the wildness inside you and doesn\u2019t try to tame it. It\u2019s about embracing the parts of yourself that society tells you to hide. And honestly? In a world that\u2019s constantly trying to box you in, that\u2019s a message I can get behind. Plus, it\u2019s just a damn good song to blast when you need to feel alive.\nShe is my new favorite artist!"

                    "plain": "Okay, so, \u201cWild Ones.\u201d Let\u2019s dive into that, because it\u2019s way more than just a catchy track. First time I heard it? Late night drive, that\u2019s a given. But here\u2019s the thing: I was actually on my way back from a terrible date. Like, the kind where you spend the whole time wondering if you accidentally wandered into a parallel universe where everyone is aggressively boring. And then \u201cWild Ones\u201d hits, and it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, this is the energy I needed.\u201d\nJessie and Jelly Roll, right? Collab of the year, hands down. But what people don\u2019t really know is that the initial demo Jessie sent Jelly Roll? It was way more stripped down. Think just her vocals and that jangly guitar loop. That verse that Jelly Roll added to the song, he actually wrote it in like, 20 minutes, sitting on his tour bus. He told a small group of peers at a meet and greet that it just poured out of him. Like, he lived that story.\nAnd about Jessie\u2019s whole \u201cdrawn to chaos\u201d thing? It\u2019s not just a persona. I\u2019ve heard from a few different sources that she keeps a journal filled with these almost poetic descriptions of the people she encounters \u2013 the ones with that spark of unpredictability. She\u2019s genuinely fascinated by the human experience when it\u2019s pushed to the edge.\nThe blend of country and hip-hop? That wasn\u2019t just a random choice. Jessie was apparently listening to a lot of old Outlaw country and early 2000s Memphis rap around the time she wrote it. She wanted to capture that feeling of rebellion, that sense of being outside the lines. And it worked.\nThe video? It\u2019s pure unedited chaos, but what most don\u2019t know is they had a very specific concept for the video. The original treatment was a much more staged, cinematic thing. But on the day of the shoot, they just threw it all out and decided to just be themselves. They wanted it to feel raw, real, and in the moment, which is why it has that authentic vibe.\nBut what really gets me about \u201cWild Ones\u201d is that it\u2019s not just about the thrill of the chase, the dangerous allure. It\u2019s about finding that kindred spirit, someone who sees the wildness inside you and doesn\u2019t try to tame it. It\u2019s about embracing the parts of yourself that society tells you to hide. And honestly? In a world that\u2019s constantly trying to box you in, that\u2019s a message I can get behind. Plus, it\u2019s just a damn good song to blast when you need to feel alive.\nShe is my new favorite artist!"
