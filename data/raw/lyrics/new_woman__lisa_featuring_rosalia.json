        "plain": "The bouncy-pop \u201cNew Woman\u201d is the second single from LISA\u2019s upcoming solo album. The song features Spanish singer ROSAL\u00cdA whom LISA is friends with and has been talking about wanting to collaborate with for a long time, mentioning ROSAL\u00cdA in her Special Birthday Q&A.\n\nInstrumentally, the song has an industrial-styled bass, synth and drum with filtered vocals and CD scratching. Vocally, LISA showcases the versatility in her singing and rap, switching between hard-on rap and soft melodies. ROSAL\u00cdA\u2019s verse slows down the tempo and she brings a new sound reminiscent of her earlier work.\n\nLyrically, LISA talks about breaking free and finding herself again after all the hardships she went through to make her name. ROSAL\u00cdA looks back on her career and expresses that her success didn\u2019t come easy either but no matter what, it\u2019s always been about the music and not the fame.\n\nThe music video was made by the experimental director Dave Meyers. In the visuals, women\u2019s every day struggles are shown metaphorically: monthly periods through falling apples, shaving body hair with glitter, changing your face with makeup, your whole image having to be a product worth selling through photocopying. Eyes are constantly framed in the video, including a guy spying on LISA and creepily watching her every move. These struggles are accompanied by ridiculous scenarios, such as walking with burning boots and vacuuming grass, showing that women have to go through crazy lengths and reach a high standard to be accepted in society, even though men constantly fight and get away with everything. ROSAL\u00cdA\u2019s scenes box her, making you feel like she can\u2019t escape. Then she creates a yin yang with LISA, visualizing that the world is not black and white but full of color like a field of flowers.\n\nThe song was first teased through posters with the lyrics \u201cpulling up fresh face brand new d\u00eda\u201d on X (Formerly Twitter), people noticed hints of names at the bottom of the poster, LA _ _ _ A (LALISA) and _ OS _ L\u00cd _ (ROSAL\u00cdA)\u2014 implying a collaboration between the two artists."

The song features Spanish singer ROSAL\u00cdA whom LISA is friends with and has been talking about wanting to collaborate with for a\u2026 Read More\u00a0\nHere I go\nBangin' it, bangin' it, wanna crack these walls\nBangin' it, bangin' it, wanna echo through the halls\nPullin' up, fresh face, brand-new day\nUh, Lalisa, Rosal\u00eda\n\nSoak up\nAll new\nSo I cut\nI go, go to the root\nOff to bloom, yeah\n\nPurple into gold\nPain has come and gone again\nWalked through that fire\nI rediscover\n\nHit it when I serve, bitch, you better swerve\nRevvin' up my au-au-au-au-aura\nFocus on my mind, takin' my time\nI'm a new woman, woman\nBitch, you better swerve\nRevvin' up my au-au-au-au-aura\nFocus on my mind, takin' my time\nI'm a new woman, woman\n\nFace, eyes, body go wild\nYou want this? I'm a new woman, woman\nEyes, I'm all about mind\nYou want this? I'm a new woman\n\n(Uh, mh)\nFor everything I am, I can flaunt it\nNot for what I have, they always give it to me\nAnd my energy's immaculate\nLow profile (And you're out)\nI live to sing, I don't sing to live\nI was born pure, yes\nNot a single era will be a flop in my future\nBitch, I'm Rosal\u00eda, I only know how to serve\nThe starry night, so be it\nUntil dawn, let it be so\n\nPurple into gold (Into gold)\nPain has come and gone again\nWalked through that fire\nI rediscover\n\nI go hard, it will work out for sure\nI rev up my au-au-au-au-aura\nI'm focused, nothing pressures me\nI'm a new woman, woman\nIt will work out for sure\nI rev up my au-au-au-au-aura\nI'm focused, nothing pressures me\nI'm a new woman, woman\n\nFace, eyes, body go wild\nYou want this? I'm a new woman, woman\nEyes, I'm all about mind\nYou want this? I'm a new woman\n\nGimme that, gimme that alpha, yuh\nGimme that bigger, the better, ugh\nFeeding you the bloom growin' out my sleeve\nKissed from a rose, rose, what a, what a meal\nBad luck a sucker, gotta make you tougher\nTryna say you suffer, oh, don't blame your mother\nElevate, I liberate a new frontier\nI'm a new woman"
